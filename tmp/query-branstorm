problem statement:
Lecture data needs to be fetched based on whether the user is logged in or not.

Where should the queries be defined? The client? The server?

CATEGORY DIMENSION:
time:
- upcoming
- retrospective
position:
- country
experience:
- highly rated
- foci 

QUERIES:

logged in:
- your chosen interests (foci)
- lectures by same lecturer that you rated high (personality) 
- lectures that you attended and rated high (retrospective)
- lectures that are popular in your country

not logged in:
- available categories (foci)
- lectures with the most participants (popularity)
- lectures by lecturers that the most highly rated (personality)


DESIGN:

endpoints that processes with multiple query params

1. lecture search points: 
    - foci
    - status
    - start date
    - duration
    - timezone
    - number of participants

2. predictive lecture search: 
    - rating
        - lectures created by a lecturer that you rated high
        - lectures on topics that you rated high


lecture_panels: [
    panel: {
        query: {
            display: '',
            config:{
                
            }
        },
        data: []
    }
]


There could be a grouping of panels.
Each grouping has a category like 'predictive'


QUESTIONS:

- would a single endpoint be able to include searches for "abstract" searches, like lectures by the same lecturer?
